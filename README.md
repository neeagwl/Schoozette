# SCHOOZETTE #

Online classes have become part of every student's life now. But still it can't fulfill the void of a Offline Class. One of the main attribute of a Offline class is competitiveness among students. Online classes cannot bring the competitive nature among students. So to tap into this problem, I have built an application which will allow user to create and enroll in new classes. A teacher can add topics and quizzez to his/her class. All the enrolled students can take quiz only in on ordered manner and thus can improve their ranking on class leaderboard.
